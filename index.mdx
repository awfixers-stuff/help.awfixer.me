### What is AJ Services?

AJ Services is a set of services designed and provided by awfixer and jinx in our spare time. We do lots of things on the internet, and we aim to make the internet a better place.

### What does AJ Services do?

we provide a series of products and services that we feel we would like to have access too ourselves. These can be used in a strictly personal capacity as we have limited resources and want to provide a fair service to everyone.

### is AJ Services a part of AWFixer and Friends?

not legally. We are a majority owner of AWFixer and Friends, though we are a seperate entity then AWFixer and Friends.
