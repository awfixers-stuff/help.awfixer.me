currently if you would like to support the work that we are doing you can do so via the mee6 monotization page for the friend group. It will get you some perks in the friend group as well as add you to the list of people who will get special perks when we release products in the future.

over the next pages I will walk you thru the state of what we are doing when it comes to money as well as our goals and some other things related to the money. This information is interesting and I try to be open about it, though it is targeted mainly at people who understand investing and returns and are looking to give me some sizable contributions and help move along the AJ Services venture.

if you are looking for my non personal business AWFixer and Friends then you can click the link below, the link will take you to the money pages for that business, which are also really cool. (everything i make is cool, what can i say...)
