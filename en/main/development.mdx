## Contributing to AJ Services

<Note>
  while we considered the idea of making our services extendable via APIs, we realized that our mission would be comprimised by doing that. So you can simply contribute to the core services rather than possibly comprimising our mission by building things that may be agains out TOS
</Note>

we will not be providing a way to extend or use our services via an API. The only way to access our services will be via the dashboard, our clients and certian approved 3rd party clients. This is because the services that we will be providing will be questioned, attacked and investigated and we do not want to open ourself to litigation by enabling people to abuse our services.

<Warning>
  if you have any questions about this then please consult our Terms of Use and Terms of Service, which go into detail about what is allowed and what is not allowed when it comes to using our services.
