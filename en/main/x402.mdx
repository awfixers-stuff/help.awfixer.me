# Gating Access to our APIs

while we believe in the ability to use our APIs, we also beleive that we live in a world where we have to defend ourselves from companies who want to steal our work to make the next AI agent that does our work for us.

because of this we have had to begin work on implimenting x402 into our APIs to ensure that people are not stealing our data. This is for both our and your protections.

When you use our APIs you will be charged 0.01 USD per request, there is no free trial or tier and the only bypasses that exist are for our own internal applications. This is because if an AI wants to scape our website, then fine they can take a peak at what we are doing. If the want access to our data then we want them to pay us just like anyone else on the internet will have to.

We are currently building an idP and SSO system that will allow for people to create paid accounts and access the API via those tokens, though currently there is a limit on how that is going as we build out our monitoring systems for compliance with our own strict policies.

happy hacking.
