# The AJ Service's Dashboard

the AJ Services Dashboard is a project that will allow you to manage all of your subscribed services, as well as the products we have that you use, in one central location. It will be secure by default, mobile friendly and designed to provide you with the amount of information that you need, while preventing information overload.

We have been known to have issues with things like SMS, Email and the different ways that for a standard they are not respected everywhere and are sort of falling apart. So we know better then to also impliment those into the things that we are working on. We do not do double standards. This means that one of the things that we are working on in the dashboard are ways that you can communicate with support, and support with you. Without requiring emails or phone numbers to facilitate the conversations.

We are also working on ways for the dashboard to be secure even when you lose access to the device you are logged in on or when you might be targeted via an evil maid attack.
