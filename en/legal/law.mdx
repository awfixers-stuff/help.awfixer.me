# When and why do we work with law Enfocement?

we work with law Enfocement whenever we feel that not working with them puts us at risk of comprimising other users.

We feel that if someone has decided that they are going to commit crimes, with or via our platform then they have decided that they do not want to use our platform and we will take the time to isolate, remove and report them.

if we did not do this then there is a chance that a government or law enforcement agency would be able to sue or supena us for data that would in turn comprimise the law abiding members of our platform.

<Note>we want to make it clear that if you are a law abiding member of our platform then we will do everything in our power to ensure that you data is not handed over to Law enforcement.</Note>

you might be asking how we figure out when someone is commit crimes on our platform, and we would love to explain that, if you check out [here](/en/legal/data) you will see the data we collect and how we process that data, which is how we then decide that your usage of our products is in the pursuit of illicit activities.

when you are found to be participating in illicit activities on our platform, your account is no longer compliant with our Terms of Use and will no longer be subject to any data deletion sections of our privacy policies. We will collect a packet of your data about your account, suspend your account to retain proof of behavior and then transmit the data about your activities to the relevant law enforcement.
