# Firewall - the Discord Bot

so what is a firewall? a firewall is an application that scans your PC blocks malicious network traffic. That is what we intend to do with firewall here, just the traffic we are working with is the traffic in your Discord Community.

firewall is built using similar principles to previous attempts at it such as double counter, alt-dentifier and many others. The difference is that while they guard your door, we guard the community as a whole.

there will be no new log channels, no new commands, no setup and no changes to your server (unless you use doublecounter or a similar bot, you will have to remove them or disable their features that may interfere with firewall).

the goal of firewall is to security discord communities without any overhead.
