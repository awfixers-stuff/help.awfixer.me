### Uploading Custom Lists

Uploading a single list of up to 100 terms is free, if you want to upload more than 100 terms or more than a single list then that is a feature that you must be a donor to access.

### Integration with automod

when you add firewall to your server it automatically creates a firewall managed automod rule that allows it to block things from being sent in your server that it knows to be malicious. If you would like to customize this rule or you would like to have firewall create other rules then you will have to be a donor.

### Bot Customization

we do not offer the ability to create custom applications that we host firewall on as that is not compliant with our policies, though if you are a donor then you will have access to the ability to customize the banner, profile picture and about me of firewall in your server.
