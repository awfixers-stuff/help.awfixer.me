# Firewall Features

### Link Management:

- firewall uses the new safe browsing v5 spec of the Google Safe Browsing API to ensure that it always has an update database and cache of known malicious links.
- Firewall also has the ability to crawl a wide variety of url shorteners to ensure that the links on the other end of the shorteners are not malicious
- Firewall is soon to have OCR abilities to detect links and other malicious content in images and other media.
- firewall has a database of good and bad videos on platforms such as youtube, oddesy, some peartube instances and we are always looking to ad more.

using this information firewall is able to detect a wide range of links, linked images and linked videos that are negative/offensive and malicious and delete them automatically, or block them before they are even sent.

### User Management:

this feature is a bit of a work in progress. Firewall is working on an extensive database of discord users and their negative behaviours. We want to build a database that is compliant with data collection and retention laws so our work on this is dilligent to the idea that we have to secure an extensive amount of information.

The flags that we currently have when it comes to users joining and staying in your server are:

- invites in the username/display name and soon to include works directing people to look in bios.
- default PFP flags 
- non nitro flags
- account age flags
- generated user name flags
- known malicious actor flags

Post join we will maintain a monitor on users in your community as it is often after a user joins a major server that they get comprimised and cause issues in your community.

### The Scam Nuker:

this idea is directly inspired by NTTS and we are happy to do something that helps make his life a bit easier. We know he does a lot of work on the discord platform and we are thankful for everything that he does.
